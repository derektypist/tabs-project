# Tabs Project

The purpose of the project is to provide the tabs project using plain JavaScript, without any frameworks.  However, Google Fonts (e.g. to Access Font Roboto) will be used.

## UX

As a user, when I hover over the tabs (other than active), I get a different color (background and foreground).

As a user, when I click on to the tabs, I expect the correct information to be displayed to that active tab.

As a user, I expect only one tab to be active.

Information Architecture - History, Vision and Goals.  Organising Principle - About.
